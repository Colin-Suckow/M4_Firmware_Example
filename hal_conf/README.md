# hal_conf

This directory contains the hardware abstraction library (HAL) configuration code generated by STM32CubeMX. This header provides clock and peripheral configuration info required by ST's HAL library.

If using STM32CubeMX to regenerate the chip configuration, copy `stm32mp1xx_hal_conf.h` into this directory and replace the existing copy.
